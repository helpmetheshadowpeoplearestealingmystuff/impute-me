rs1815739	11	NA		T	C	Table1	This C variant of this SNP breaks the ACTN3. The T variant have been found to be associated with better sprint performance (PMID 12879365). The evidence supporting this is solid, with numerous meta-analysis performed - all with the same result. However, while it is a true finding (significance) it is also recommended to understand the limited magnitude of the SNP (effect size). The odds ratio for each T is 1.3, which is the added probability of being an elite athlete. This means that even in the olympic sprint it is likely that C/C individuals are participating (although to my knowledge, no one has ever made this study).	0.4			C/T	C	T
rs4646994	17	NA		NA	NA	Table1	ACE - this variant is found in one study to potentially distinguish between capability in power-sports vs endurance-sports (PMID 25943990). However it is also mentioned in several studies of other traits such as hypertension and alzheimers. The evidence behind it's effect remain unclear. Insertations (I) are the ones supposed to be associated with endurance, and deletions (D) with power-sports. Note that the imputation often fails for this SNP, meaning that many users will see a 'blank' result.				I/D
